<h1>Tutorial for JavaScript Turtle Graphics</h1>
<section>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>
JavaScript is an important language, because it is the language used in
browsers to bring life to web pages. It dynamically resizes elements so that
the same page can be used on a mobile phone or desktop computer. It dynamically
loads data, like weather data or news stories, as it changes or as you
move down on the page. It provides
motion and interest to web pages. JavaScript also checks user inputs before
a request is sent back to the server.
</p>

</section>

<p>
Learning JavaScript programming in a graphics environment is an easy way to get
introduced to JavaScript. The JavaScript Turtle Graphics page at
<a href="http://turtlegraphics.fun">http://turtlegraphics.fun</a> is written in
JavaScript and it provides an environment for exploring JavaScript and its use
of graphics using traditional turtle graphics functions.
</p>
<p>
This tutorial assumes that you have some basic knowledge.
Go to <a href="./javascript.html">JavaScript Tutorial</a>
or the <a href="./guide.html">Guide for the Integrated Development
Environment (IDE)</a> if you need more information.
</p>
<p>
In these lessons there are small programs to load and play with. It is
important to type these programs in and to try them out. Typing reinforces
the lesson with muscle memory of the act of typing and forcing you to
recognize each character. Just reading the lesson is not enough. It is also
necessary to play around with each lesson. Change some of the parameters or
the way that the program works. You should be able to predict what will happen
when you change things, so that you can change things to be the way you want
them to be.

<h2>Hello World</h2>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_b6424b9e9cd87037.png" alt="">
<p>
When programmers are
faced with a new language, the first thing that they do is to write
a simple program that tests their understanding of the language,
its syntax and the operation of the new language. Typically this is a
&quot;Hello World&quot; program. For this environment such a program would
be as follows:
</p>
<code class="tryme">write (&quot;Hello World&quot;)
</code>

<p>
Click on the <span class="button">Run Demo</span> button.
</p>
<p>
What happened? You
should see Hello World printed on the canvas, but printed sideways.
Text is written along the direction that the turtle is pointing without
moving the turtle.
</p>
</section>
<p>
<code>write()</code> is a
A <strong>function</strong> perform a desired action and are composed of
instructions and possibly other functions. Functions allow a programmer to
use them without having to worry about all of the underlying
details. Turtle Graphics is written using functions that hide the
details from the user.
</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>
<strong>Syntax</strong> is a funny word. No, it is not a tax on your sins.
It is the mechanics of the language. It is how you string words and punctuation
or symbols together so that the intent of the language can be understood by
humans and computers. Just as English has its rules for putting sentences
together, JavaScript has its rules. The only thing to know is that computers
are not as flexible as humans in being able to figure out what is meant if
the syntax isn't correct. Preciseness is the rule in computer languages.
</p>
<p>
Case, as in upper case and lower case, is important to
JavaScript, so <code>Write </code>is different than <code>write</code> and is
different than <code>wriTe</code>. This property is called case sensitive. Most
passwords are case sensitive. Can you think of other examples?
</p
<p>
All functions in
JavaScript are followed by open and close parentheses. This is
the syntax that tells JavaScript that the preceding
name is a function. If there is nothing between the parentheses, the function
takes no <strong>parameters</strong>.
The function <code>write(<em>string</em>)</code> does take a single parameter,
a string that you want to put on the canvas, and that is put between the parentheses.
Functions can take a number of parameters depending on the function. Any
number of parameters is allowed, although it gets hard to remember the purpose
of each parameter as the number increases.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>string</strong> is a set of characters
The syntax for a string is to enclose a set of characters with
quotation marks. This distinguishes the string from other
characters which could be a function name, variable name, or other value.
In English we use quotation marks to set off the spoken words or special words
from other words in a sentence. JavaScript sets off strings.
Either single or double quotes are acceptable, as long
as it is the same type is used on both ends. Just about any character can
be included in a string, but including a quotation mark requires some
consideration. A simple way is to enclose the string with a quotation mark
is to use the other kind of quotation marks to enclose the string.
So, you could use &quot;G'day world&quot;, if you want
the Australian version of “Hello World.”
</p>

    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_fe08b6fc287c210d.png" alt="">
<p>
The program as it is,
isn't quite right. The <code>write()</code> function displays a text
string in the direction that the turtle is moving without moving the
turtle. We want the text to go horizontally to make it easier to read.
We need to rotate the text 90° in a clockwise direction. We can do that
by turning the turtle before invoking the <code>write()</code> function,
by invoking a <code>right(90)</code> function to ask it to turn 90 degrees
to its right.
Because this programming has more than one line,
lets use the coding area, so we can edit the programs and make
changes to it as necessary. The resulting program for the
coding area is:
</p>
<code class="tryme">right (90)
write (&quot;Hello World&quot;)
</code>

<p>
Click on the <span class="button">Run Demo</span> button,
you should see something like the figure on the right.
</p>
</section>

<p>
The <code>right()</code> function also takes a
parameter like write, but right's parameter is the number of degrees
to turn right. Look at the parameters of the two functions. Write takes
a string of characters or more simply just a string. A string is enclosed in
either 'single quotes' or "double quotes." If you need to enclose a quote mark or
apostrophe in a string, just use the other type of quote. You may also "escape"
the quote mark with a backslash character '\'. Escaping is fairly common in
program languages to allow a character to be used as itself (or as something 
completely different than its normal usage). As you learn programming you
will probably encounter more examples of escaping or escape mechanisms.
</p>
<code class="tryme">right (90)
write ("That's fun! Don't forget to try this at \"home.\"")
</code>
<p>
Part of JavaScript's
syntax, is that <strong>white space</strong> is not too important so you can add
spaces, tabs or carriage returns (sometimes called newlines) here or there to make
the code easier to read. Each JavaScript statement is usually
written in a single line, although an exceptions is made for long
statements that read better with multiple lines. Each line in formal
JavaScript must end in a semi-colon ';' as in:
</p>

<code class="tryme">right( 90);
write ( &quot;Hello World&quot;);
</code>

<p>
We are writing in a
more casual syntax that does not require this semi-colon. Just
beware that some syntax checkers will require more semi-colons. If
multiple codes statements are placed on one line, the code
statements must be separated with semi-colons.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Comments</strong> are important
to remind you or the next reader what the code is attempting to do.
(Sometimes the code misses the intent, so it is important to state
the intent, and to keep that up to date as the code changes.).
JavaScript has two types of comments. A comment that just tacks on
the end of a line starts with a double slash <code>//</code> and goes to
the end of the line. A multi-line comment starts with slash-star
<code>/*</code> and ends with a star-slash <code>*/</code>. Multi-line comments
may not be nested, because the comment ends with the scanning of
the first star-slash after the first slash-star. The second slash-star
isn't seen by JavaScript because it is in a comment. The second star-slash
doesn't have a lead in slash-star as far as JavaScript is concerned so
it is a syntax error.
</p>

<p>
So both <code>right()</code> and <code>write()</code>,
are functions. These hide the details of their implementation for
their user. JavaScript allows its users to define their own
functions. We can define a 'Hello World' function, ‘hi()’  as:
</p>

<code class="tryme">function hi () {
  right( 90);
  write ( &quot;Hello World&quot;);
}
</code>

<p>
The word <span class="keyword">function</span> is a
<strong>key word</strong> in JavaScript that tells it that you want to define a
function. <strong>Key words</strong> are words reserved by a language, JavaScript
in this case, to signal some intent to the programming language.
Key words cannot be used for other purposes.
The key word <span class="keyword">function</span> is followed by the name
you want to give to the function. You should
pick a unique name for the function, as this definition will
override any previous definition. The open and close parentheses
tell JavaScript that the function definition includes no parameters
in this case. Even though there are no parameters, the parentheses
are still needed. The open and close curly brace are used to mark the
beginning and end of a block of statements to be executed when the
<code>hi()</code> function is invoked.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>
Try to execute the program by pressing on the
<span class="button">Run Demo</span>.
You should get a error message about <strong>demo</strong> being undefined.
This is because the <span class="button">Run Demo</span> tries to invoked the
<code>demo()</code> function, and it isn't defined in the coding area.
So let's adds a <code>demo()</code> function to the program:
</p>

<code class="tryme">function hi () {
  right( 90);
  write ( &quot;Hello World&quot;);
}

function demo () {
}
</code>
</section>

<section>
<p>
Now try to execute the program again by pressing on the
<span class="button">Run Demo</span>.
The error has gone
away, but nothing has executed. Why? We defined <code>demo()</code> as requested,
but as defined, it does nothing.  The <code>hi()</code> function
was never called or invoked. Let's add a call or invocation to the <code>hi()</code>
function in the <code>demo()</code> function.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function hi () {
  right( 90);
  write ( &quot;Hello World&quot;);
}

function demo () {
  hi()
}
</code>

<p>
Now when you press the
<span class="button">Run Demo</span> button, the turtle should print
&quot;Hello World&quot; on the canvas.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>
What happens if you
press the <span class="button">Run Demo</span> button more than once? Why?
</p>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_9adb0f80a6146c6b.png" alt="">
<p>
We can fix that by
clearing the screen by invoking the <code>reset ()</code> function  before
writing to the canvas.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function hi () {
  right( 90);
  write ( &quot;Hello World&quot;);
}

function demo () {
  reset()
  helloWorld()
}
</code>
You can try to introduce other syntax errors in the program to see the
error message the JavaScript produces. Sometimes the message does not say
exactly what the problem is, only what JavaScript perceives the problem to be.
Think of it as more of a hint or suggestion, rather than something specific.
It is good to get an idea of how JavaScript reports the syntax problems
the it detects for a known problem so that you get a better idea of what
it is trying to tell you for a random error.

<h2>Your First Graphic</h2>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_b3fc22dd53f0c1d6.png" alt="">
OK, but Turtle Graphics is a graphics program, shouldn’t we
be doing some graphics? Let's see it draw some lines as sort of a
graphical Hello World example. Let's try to do a simple square.

<code class="tryme">forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
</code>
</section>

<section>
<p>
Ok, let’s do the same thing, but do it with by defining a function to draw the
square, as we have learned previously.
</p>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_2891944c53476dfe.png" alt="">

<code class="tryme">function square1 () {
  forward(100)
  right(90)
  forward(100)
  right(90)
  forward(100)
  right(90)
  forward(100)
  right(90)
}

function demo () {
  reset()
  square1()
}
</code>
</section>

<section>
<p>
Let's see some of the power of a function with a simple change to draw three
squares rotated 30° about the starting point. Change the <code>demo ()</code>
function as follows:
</p>

    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_cae1dc59a219b5c6.png" alt="">
<code class="tryme">function square1 () {
  forward(100)
  right(90)
  forward(100)
  right(90)
  forward(100)
  right(90)
  forward(100)
  right(90)
}

function demo () {
  reset()
  square1()
  right(30)
  square1()
  right(30)
  square1()
}
</code>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Repeating </h2>
<p>
Great! Now looking at the function
square1(), there is a lot of repetition. There are a couple of ways to
do this. Using the Turtle Graphics function <code>repeat()</code>, the
code would look something like:
</p>
<code class="tryme">// square with repeat
function el () {
  forward (100)
  right (90)
}

function square () {
  repeat (4, el)
}

function demo () {
  reset()
  square()
}
</code>
</section>
<aside>
<p>
There is a method can get rid of the standalone <code>el()</code> function
when using the <code>repeat()</code> function. The code is shown below.
</p>
<code class="tryme">repeat( 4, function() {
    forward( 100)
    right( 90)}
  )
</code>
<p>
This works, but its syntax is hard to get right especially for beginners.
All of the parentheses and curly braces have to be paired just right.
This is called an <strong>anonymous function</strong> because it is a
function without a name.
</p>
</aside>
<p>
But the repeat function is messy and not really the JavaScript way of doing
things. Let's not use the <code>repeat()</code> function and use a with a
<code>while</code> statement instead. The simplest JavaScript program using
a <code>while</code> statement is something like:
</p>
<code class="tryme">var i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    i = i + 1
}
</code>

<p>
What does this do? The key word <span class="keyword">var</span> is used
to define a <strong>variable</strong>, or more specifically where a variable
is defined.  <span class="var">i</span> is the name of a variable
being declared. The <strong>statement</strong> <code>i = 0</code>, is an
assignment of the value 0 to the variable <span class="var">i</span>. This
could be read as: "set variable <span class="var">i</span> to 0."
The JavaScript statement <code>i = 0</code> is just a short hand form of that.
This is definitely not the way normal arithmetic symbols are used, because
here '=' means 'assign' or 'set', even though after the assignment, i is
equal to 0.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes a variable is declared without setting it to an initial value, so
its value would be <strong>undefined</strong>. In general this is
a fairly bad idea. It is definitely an error to use a variable
before its value is assigned.
</p>
<p>
The next statement is
the while statement. <span class="keyword">while</span> is a key word that
signals to repeat the following statement or group of statements surrounded
by an open and close curly brace, while the condition enclosed between the
open and close parentheses evaluates to true. The only statement within the
curly brackets is <code>i = i + 1</code>.
</p>
<p>
So what happens when this is run.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the variable <span class="var">i</span> is allocated and set to 0.</li>
  <li>
    since <span class="var">i</span> (being 0) is less than 4, the group of
    statements is executed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="var">i</span> is set to <span class="var">i</span> + 1.
    <span class="var">i</span> is now 1.
  </li>
  <li>
    control returns to the <code>while</code> statement
  </li>
  <li>
    since <span class="var">i</span> (being 1) is less than 4, the group of
    statements is executed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="var">i</span> is set to <span class="var">i</span> + 1.
    <span class="var">i</span> is now 2.
  </li>
  <li>
    control returns to the <code>while</code> statement.
  </li>
  <li>
    since <span class="var">i</span> (being 2) is less than 4, the group of
    statements is executed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="var">i</span> is set to <span class="var">i</span> + 1.
    <span class="var">i</span> is now 3.
  </li>
  <li>
    control returns to the <code>while</code> statement.
  </li>
  <li>
    since <span class="var">i</span> (being 3) is less than 4, the group
    of statements is executed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="var">i</span> is set to <span class="var">i</span> + 1.
    <span class="var">i</span> is now 4.
  </li>
  <li>
    control returns to the <code>while</code> statement.
  </li>
  <li>
    since <span class="var">i</span> (being 4) is no longer less than 4,
    the group of statements is skipped over.
  </li>
</ul>
<section>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_6bdc2aa2387413b8.png" alt="">

<p>
This is all hard to see, so let's make it more visible. Let's print the
value of <span class="var">i</span> inside of the loop. Since the
<code>write()</code> function doesn't move the turtle, we need to do that
as well by drawing the now familiar square. By the way, printing a variable
during execution is a common tool used by programmers to see what is happening
inside of a program when trying to debug the program.
</p>
<p>
The program uses a while loop to repeat four times: write a number, draw a side,
turn the corner, and increment the number of sides.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square() {
  var i = 0
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    write (i)
    forward (100)
    right(90)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function demo() {
  reset()
  square()
}
</code>
<p>
JavaScript has two other common looping techniques. One is a <code>do...while</code>
statement.
The block of code to be repeated is after the <span class="keyword">do</span>
key word and the  <span class="keyword">while</span>is after the repeated block
of code. So the block is always executed at least once where in a while statement
the block may not be executed at all.
The equivalent code for drawing a square is shown below.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) {
  var i = 0
  do {
    forward( 50);
    right( 90)
    i = i + 1
  } while (i < 4)
}

function demo() {
  reset()
  square()
}
</code>
<p>
This pattern for looping through a block of code is very common
in programming, so JavaScript uses
a technique used in other languages like C to do a <code>for</code> loop.
A <code>for</code> loop allows the programmer to do the three required steps
of a loop in a single statement. These parts are
separated with semicolons, just as multiple statements on
a line would be separated. The code for a <code>for</code> loop to
draw a square is as follows:
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) {
  for( var i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) { // init; test; and change i
    forward( 100) // block of code is within curly braces
    right( 90)
  }
}

function demo() {
  reset()
  square()
}
</code>
</section>
The bottom line is
that the inner group of statements is executed exactly 4 times. This type of
loop is also called an <strong>iterative</strong> loop as it is executed a
counted number of times. The control variable, <span class="var">i</span>
in this case, is sometimes called an <strong>iterator</strong>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Function Parameters and Arguments</h2>
<p>
Wow! OK. Let's say we want to draw another square, but of a different size.
We can copy the <code> square()</code> function code, change the function
name, say to <code>square200()</code>, change the <code>forward(100)</code>
to the size you want say, <code>forward(200)</code>.
</p>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_4103b621a22e21c4.png" alt="">
<p>
Now if you want to draw a square of 100 or 200 points, you are set. But if
you want another size, you have to do the copy and change routine all over
again. There is a better way. That is to a <strong>parameter</strong> to
the basic <code>square()</code> function. We'll tell
JavaScript that we want to pass a value in the function definition by including
the parameter name or names within the parentheses as in the following code.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) {
  for( i=0; i<4; i=i+1) {
    forward( side);
    right( 90)
  }
}

function demo () {
  reset()
  square(100) // 100 is an argument
}
</code>
<p>
When the program is executed the value of side is used in the
<code>forward( side)</code> statement. To use that value, we
just pass an <strong>argument</strong> to the square function by placing
the argument, say '100,' within the parentheses, as in: <code>square (100)</code>.

<p>
Putting the two together, the code should look something like the figure to
the right.  We also need to modify
the function call in the <code>demo()</code> function to use the new arguments.
When the function is invoked, it is supplied with arguments. The value of
the arguments is passed to the parameter in the corresponding position defined
with the function.
Of all this there can be no argument, or was that a parameter.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) { // side is a parameter
  var i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    forward (side) // here the parameter is accessed
                   // it is like a variable local
                   // to the function square()
    right(90)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function demo () {
  reset()
  square(100) // 100 is an argument
}
</code>

<p>
Hey, isn’t that just like we did before. That was a lot of work to change the
code, just to do the same thing.
Why would you do that? To show off the power of a function with parameters,
we can now use the iterator, so let's put in an iterator into the demo
program that turns the square while changing its size.
Let's do this one step at a time. First just turn it.
</p>
</div>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) {
  var i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    forward (side)
    right(90)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function demo () {
  reset()
  var i = 0
  while (i &lt; 12) {
    square(75)
    turn (30) // turn the square
    i = i + 1
  }
}
</code>
</section>
<section>
  <img src="./images/no_picture.png">
<p>
The next modification to the code also
changes the size of the squares and their color with each iteration within
the while loop of the <code>demo()</code> function.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) {
  var i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    forward (side)
    right(90)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function demo () {
  reset()
  var i = 0
  while ( i &lt; 12) {
    color (i)
    square(i * 10)
    turn (30)
    i = i + 1
  }
}
</code>
</section>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<section>
<p>
Great. You may have noticed something funny. Both the <code>square()</code>
and <code>demo*()</code>functions use the same
variable name <span class="var">i</span> for the iterator.
Don't they conflict? No. In this case <span class="var">i</span> is defined
as a local variable within the curly braces of each function with the
<span class="keyword">var</span>.
This means the variables only have meaning within the <strong>local</strong>
context of the function in which they are defined.
</p>
<p>
If <span class="var">i</span>
had been defined outside of the functions at the <strong>global</strong> level
as in the following code, there would be trouble.
</p>
<code class="tryme">var i;
function square(side) {
  i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    forward (side)
    right(90)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function demo () {
  reset()
  i = 0
  while ( i &lt; 12) {
    color (i)
    square(i * 10)
    turn (30)
    i = i + 1
  }
}
</code>
<p>
Both functions would access the same variable and this would make the routines much
harder to debug because both functions would be changing the value
of <span class="var">i</span>.
The general sequence of what happens in the code is:
<ul>
<li>
demo function starts up and sets i to 0.
</li>
<li>
demo invokes square(0 * 10)
</li>
<li>
square sets i to 0, which at this point is OK.
</li>
<li>
square loops through the values of i until it reaches 4 and it
returns control to the demo program.
</li>
<li>
demo increments i from 4 to 5. Oops, what happened to 1, 2, 3 and 4?
</li>
<li>
demo invokes square (5 * 10)
</li>
<li>
square sets i to 0, which at this point is backing up.
</li>
<li>
square loops through the values of i until it reaches 4 and it
returns control to the demo program.
</li>
<li>
demo increments i from 4 to 5. Oops, we're back to where we were and
the program is stuck in an infinite loop.
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<p>
If you run this program on the IDE, it will lock up. The easy way to get out
of this is to wait for the browser to detect that a web page is taking too
much time and it issues and alert box asking to stop the window or to continue.
You should stop the window and reload the IDE page. It probably is a good idea
to recognize when something is wrong and what to do to fix it.
</p>
<p>
In general it is better to use local variables than
ones defined globally for several reasons:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
  The same name can be used without conflict in other functions.
</li>
<li>
  Only the code within the function can access the local variable.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Sometimes global variables are
necessary when you need to share data between functions or when a
variable needs to last longer than just the time that a function is
called (a property called <strong>persistence</strong>). A local  variable
within a function is created each time the function is run, so it has no
knowledge of previous executions. A global variable lives outside of the
function so it is not affected by individual function invocations, although
to be useful, the function may be changing that value for its own benefit. If
other functions mess with that variable, and there is nothing to stop them
from doing so except for programmer discipline, the variable may not work
as expected.
</p>
<p>
Variables default to being global, if you do not use the
<span class="keyword">var</span> key word to define them.
A variable can be made local by declaring the
variable with the <span class="keyword">var</span> key word within the
curly braces of a function definition. Think of
the location of the <span class="keyword">var</span> variable declaration
as the location of the variable. Inside a function: it is local to that function;
outside the functions: it is global to all.
</p>
<p>
This example also introduced the <code>color()</code> function. It works
with simple numbered colors like a numbered box of crayons. It is limited to
a number between 0 and 15. This works great in this case, except for white,
which is number 7, doesn't show up well on a white background.

<h2>Randomness</h2>
<p>
So far we have drawn things with attributes that we assign in the code. What
about having the program make up values and use them on the fly.
Let’s try to place
random-colored, random-sized squares at random places on the canvas.
It sounds like we need a random number generating function. The
<code>random()</code> function
fills the need. This has two forms: one with one number and one with
two numbers. The single number form generates an integer
between 0 and the value supplied. The two number form generates
an integer between the two numbers.
</p>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_94de213c6962653a.png" alt="">
<p>
We used the <code>color()</code> function in the last exercise.  It works on
a number between 0 and 15, so <code>random( 15)</code> will work for a random
color (as long has you are happy with crayon colors).
</p>

  <img src="./images/no_picture.png">
<p>
To position the start
of the square anywhere on the canvas, the <code>goto(x,y)</code> function
can be used. A Cartesian coordinate system is used with x=0, y=0 at
the center of the canvas. (see example of Cartesian coordinates.)
The values at the edges of the canvas will vary from machine to
machine and with the size of the particular window. There are
functions to retrieve the minimum and maximum X values, <code>minX()</code>
and <code>maxX()</code> respectively. <code>minX()</code> returns the left
most x point and <code>maxX()</code> returns the right most x point.
The <code>minY()</code> and <code>maxY()</code> functions do
the same for the Y values. These functions are necessary because the
screen size is different for different devices and can change at will
on laptops and desktop machines as the browser window is changed.
</p>
<p>
We need to pick a random number for a random x and a random y on the
canvas for the <code>goto()</function></code>.
<code>random( minX(), maxX())</code> will pick a suitable x value and
<code>random( minY(), maxY())</code> will pick a suitable y value.
This is put altogether in the following code. Note that the x and y parameter
positions in the definition of the <code>goto()</code> function definition
determine the order of the arguments when invoking the <code>goto()</code>
function.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) {
  i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    forward (side)
    right(90)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function demo(){
  var i
  reset()
  for (i=0; i&lt;20; i= i + 1) {
    color( random(15))
    goto (random( minX(), maxX()), random(minY(), maxY()))
    square( random( 15,150))
  }
}
</code>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Simple Animated Build</h2>
<p>
Simple animations can be done with the <code>animate()</code>
function. The function just repeats calls to the function named in its first
argument after a delay of the number of milliseconds (1/1000 second) specified
by the second argument. By not clearing or resetting the canvas between calls,
the effects just build on the canvas. The program can be stopped by pressing the
<span class="button">Stop</span> button.
</p>
<p>
Let's use the same basic program that we used in the last exercise.
We need to break the <code>demo()</code> function into two parts, because
animate needs to call a function that draws something on the canvas.
The iteration is no longer needed, because that is effectively done by
the <code>animate()</code> function. The <code>reset()</code> should only be
done in the demo function as well as the <code>animate()</code> function.
Everything else can be put into a <code>randomSquare()</code> function.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) {
  i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    forward (side)
    right(90)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function randomSquare(){
  color( random(15))
  goto (random( minX(), maxX()), random(minY(), maxY()))
  square( random( 15,150))
}

function demo(){
  reset()
  animate( randomSquare, 100) // pass address of function,
                              // not results of the function
}
</code>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_b25a59c93ee7a6db.png" alt="">
<p>
A funny thing is
happening with the reference of <code>randomSquare</code> in the <code>demo()</code>
function above. This is passing the address of the <code>randomSquare()</code>
function to the <code>animate()</code> function. Animate executes the
function at the address passed to it. By dropping the parentheses
from the <code>demo2()</code> function, the address of the function is used
rather than to attempt to invoke the function immediately as is done with the
<code>random()</code>, <code>minX()</code>, <code>minY()</code>,
<code>maxX()</code>, <code>maxY()</code> functions elsewhere in the code.
</p>
<p>
The squares can be
rotated as well by throwing in a turn (random(something)) into the
mix.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) {
  i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    forward (side)
    right(90)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function randomSquare(){
  color( random(15))
  goto (random( minX(), maxX()), random(minY(), maxY()))
  right(random( 5, 30))
  square( random( 15,150))
}

function demo(){
  reset()
  animate( randomSquare, 100) // pass address of function,
                              // not results of the function
}
</code>
</section>

<section>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_68208927fe627e54.png" alt="">
<p>
The line widths of squares can also be varied by throwing in <code>width</code>
function. So in keeping with the randomness theme, why not make the lines a
random width with <code>width (random(</code>something<code>))</code> into the mix.
You may not want lines that are too thin (zero?) or too wide, so limit the range
of the widths. This code looks something like the following.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function square(side) {
  i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; 4) {
    forward (side)
    right(90)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function randomSquare(){
  color( random(15))
  goto (random( minX(), maxX()), random(minY(), maxY()))
  right(random( 5, 30))
  width( random( 1, 6))
  square( random( 15,150))
}

function demo(){
  reset()
  animate( randomSquare, 100) // pass address of function,
                              // not results of the function
}
</code>
</section>
<p>
By adding minor changes to the code, we are able to have some fairly
dramatic changes to the generated graphic. Most programming is like this.
Start out with some thing that works and then add more functionality in
little steps until it is what you want.

<h2>Polygons</h2>
<h2>Generalizing
the square function for a polygon function</h2>
<p>
We can <strong>generalize</strong> the <code>square()</code> function to make
it can make polygons. Generalize here means to take the basic idea of a
function and make it so that it can do more easily.  We've already generalize a
simple square function into one that you can specify the length of its sides.
Now we want to generalize the <code>square()</code> function so that it so that
it can generate a polygon.
<ul>
<li>
  What additional parameter(s) is(are) needed?
</li>
<li>
  Can you calculate the corner angle?
</li>
<li>
  What is the smallest number of parameters that are needed.?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The answers are on the
next page if you get stuck, but try to solve these without looking.
</p>
</section>

<section>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_3d9cdc3cc0c77a16.png" alt="">
<p>
For the square, take 360°, divided by 4 gives 90° for
each angle. For a triangle, take 360°, divided by 3 gives 120°
for each angle. This is the outside angle, not the inside angle.
Some of you may know that an equilateral triangle, has three sides of the same
length and three 60° angles.
Generalizing for polygons, take 360° 
and divide by the number of sides to get the angle.
This would mean that a general polygon can be generated by the length of its
sides and the number of sides required.
</p>
<code class="tryme">function polygon (size, n) {
  var i = 0
  while (i < n) {
    write (i)
    forward (size)
    right (360/n)
    i = i + 1
  }
}

function demo() {
  reset()
  for (var i=3; i < 10; i = i+1) {
    polygon( 40+2*i, i)
  }
}
</code>

<p>
Now let's go one step further and try to draw pointed stars, that we will call spikeys.
What about a five-pointed star? It has a lot of similarities as the polygon.
Both end up in the same place and same direction as the start.
Both have five corners and the corners are in the same place.
One difference is a spikey is concave between points, where a polygon is flat.
Another difference is that in drawing a polygon, the turtle only goes around the
center point once. When drawing a star, the turtle would have to go around twice.
</li>
<li>
  In a polygon, how many times to you go around the center point.
</li>
<li>
  In a five-pointed star, how many times do you go around the center point?
</li>
<li>
  Can you use that number to calculate the angle that you need to turn?
</li>
<li>
  Can you generalize this?
</li>
<li>
  Are there exceptions?
</li>
<li>
  Is there a maximum?
</li>
</ul>
times and still end up in the same starting position and angle?
<p>
When you draw the star free hand, you go around
the center point twice and you make 5 turns. You can use that to
determine the angle. Twice around the center is twice 360° or 720°.
Dividing this by the number of points, 5, yields 144°. Remember this is the
turning angle for the turtle. The inside angle is 180° minus the turning
angle or 36°.
</p>

<section>
    <img src="images/Javascript%20Turtle%20Graphics%202_html_4616c1221a3e84ea.png" alt="">
<p>
The limit to the
number of times that you can go around the center point is <em><strong>n/2</strong></em>
where <em><strong>n</strong></em> is the number of points in the star.
Going around more than  <em><strong>n/2</strong></em> times, produces the same result
as a lower number,
but the figure is in the opposite direction. If the number of points is
divisible by the number of revolutions, the figure will close
prematurely. So <em><strong>n</strong></em> works best if it is prime. With the
number of revolutions close to <em><strong>n/2</strong></em>, the figure is most
spikey. As <em><strong>n</strong></em> gets smaller, the opening in the
center gets bigger and bigger and the outer ring gets narrower and
narrower.
