   <h2 id="basic grammar">Basic JavaScript Grammar</h2>
     <p>
This is a brief tutorial on JavaScript. Read as much as you can, but come back
to review or to learn a new concept.  If you need more depth, there are
other tutorials and guides on JavaScript on the internet or in your library.
     </p>
     <h3>Comments</h3>
       <p>
         A <strong>comment</strong>  is a note left by the developer to others, including the
         developer, about some aspect of the code. This makes the code
         easier to understand. Comments are not executed by the JavaScript
         interpreter, so they provide no functionality. Yet they are very
         (important as a way to communicate intent. Comments can also be
         used to turn off sections of code during testing.
       </p>
       <p>
         JavaScript has two kinds of comments.
         <ul>
         <li>
         A line end comment starts with a double slash <code>//</code> and
         runs to the end of the current line. The line may or may not
         contain other JavaScript code before the double slash.
         </li>
         <code>// comment to the end of the line
a = 1 // comment after code to end of line
</code>
         <li>
         A bounded comment is fenced in by a slash-star <code>/*</code> start
         sequence and ends in a star-slash <code>*/</code> sequence.
         Bounded comments may cover several lines, it may be a whole line
         of code, or it may be within a line of code.
         Bounded comments may not be nested as it will end on the first
         occurrence of star-slash <code>*/</code>.
         This type of comment is used by several other languages including
         C, C++, Java, and CSS.
         </li>
         <code>/*
a bounded comment
may span more than
one line
*/
/* a bounded comment may be a single line */
a /* a bounded comment may be within code  */ = 1;
/* bounded comments /* cannot be nested */ syntax error */
</code>
         </ul>
       </p>
     <h3 id=functions>Functions</h3>
       <p>
         JavaScript allows the programmer to define blocks of code that can
         be used over and over. These blocks are called
         <span class="keywod">function</span>s.
         Some functions may take <strong>arguments</strong> as inputs,
         others do not. It is
         up to the programmer to decide what the function will do, whether
         it takes parameters and whether it returns a result. A function may
         be called a procedure, a subroutine, or other names. These names
         are generally talking about the same thing that JavaScript calls a
         function. A function is <strong>invoked</strong> in a statement by using its name
         followed by a opening and closing parentheses '(' and ')'. There
         may be arguments between the parentheses.
       </p>
       <p>
         A simple example could be a function that draws a square on the
         canvas. The turtle is moved to where the
         shape is required and the function is invoked.
       </p>
       <code>// define the square function
function square () {
  forward (100);
  right (90);
  forward (100);
  right (90);
  forward (100);
  right (90);
  forward (100);
  right (90);
}

square () { // invoke the square function
right(30)   // invoke the Turtle Graphic right() function
            // with the distance argument 30
square () { // invoke the square function again
right(30)   // invoke the Turtle Graphic right() function again
square () { // invoke the square function once again
</code>
       <p>
         Good functions have no side effects, that is, they should not change
         the value of global variables. So a function that draws a shape
         should leave the turtle in the same position as it
         was when the function was called and pointing in the same direction.
         Of course there are exceptions like a function that draws
         a fancy corner. The point is, the function should be predictable
         and not have a side effect which would manifest itself as a
         nasty bug down the road.
       </p>
     <h3 id=variables>Variables</h3>
       <p>
         Variables are used to store a value for later use.  Sometimes it is
         for convenience.  For instance, it is a lot easier to remember and
         type <span class="var">pi</span>, than it is to remember and type
         <span class="var">3.141596...</span>
         Sometimes a variable is used is to remember a partial result, like
         how many times has the race car gone around the track or how many
         brothers and sisters do you have.
       </p>
       <code>a = 1;   // assign the value of the integer '1' to the variable 'a'.
a = 1.0;   // assign the value of the number '1.0' to the variable 'a'.
a = "cabbage"; // assign the string "cabbage" to the variable 'a'.
a = true; // assign the Boolean value true to the variable 'a'.
</code>
       <p>
        Variable names that have a clear meaning make code easier to read
        and understand.
        For example: <code>lapsCompleted = 3</code> is easy to understand. 
        <code>l = 3</code> can be difficult to understand.  What is
        <span class="var">l</span>"
        and how is it being used? Is that the letter <strong>l</strong> or the digit
        <strong>1</strong>.
        Variables have some restrictions on naming:
        <ul>
        <li>
          cannot start with a digit.
        </li>
        <li>
          cannot contain an operator character, any of
          +-%/*!~<>{}[]()&lt;&gt;;,.&#39;&quot;&amp;|\ 
        </li>
        <li>
          cannot be a <strong>key word</strong> (a word reserved by the JavaScript
          language (e.g., <span class="keyword">if</span>,
          <span class="keyword">then</span>,
          <span class="keyword">var</span>,
          <span class="keyword">while</span>,
          <span class="keyword">function</span>).
        </li>
        <li>
          can contain any lower or upper case letter.</li>
        <li>
          can contain one or more digits as long as it is not the starting
          character.
        </li>
        <li>can contain any of the following symbols: $_. These can be the
          starting character, but usually are not, mainly because of
          conventions of other languages.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        So the following are acceptable as variable names:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            allowance,
          </li>
          <li>
            nationalDebt,
          </li>
          <li>
            national_debt,
          </li>
          <li>
            gradePointAverage,
          </li>
          <li>
            address2,
          </li>
          <li>
            sunshinePercent.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
      The following are unacceptable as variable names:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            2week,
          </li>
          <li>
            national-debt,
          </li>
          <li>
            if,
          </li>
          <li>
            sunshine%,
          </li>
          <li>
            function.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Variable names are <strong>case sensitive</strong>, so Dog and dog
        and doG are different names. It usually is not a good idea to use
        names with the only difference being the case of the letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variables are <strong>declared</strong> with the
        <span class="keyword">var</span> keyword.
        Variables may be <strong>initialized</strong> or <strong>assigned</strong>
        at the same time as they are declared. JavaScript is 
        not strict about declaring variables, but it is a good idea to do so.
      </p>
      <code>var lapsCompleted; // declared but not initialized
var lapsToGo = 50; //declared and initialized
lapsToGo = 51; //previously declared, now assigned
</code>
      <p>
        Each variables should be declared only once by using the reserved
        key word <span class="keyword">var</span> and should be declared
        before they are used elsewhere.
      </p>

     <h3>Data Types</h3>
      <p>
       JavaScript has four primitive data types. They are:
      </p>
       <ul>
         <li>number (e.g., 1, 1.1, -2)</li>
         <li>string (e.g., "a", "hi", "How are you?",
                       'What do you know?')</li>
         <li>Boolean (e.g., true, false)</li>
         <li>undefined
         </li>
         </ul>
       <p> A primitive data type is only composed of itself or data types like
       it, e.g., <code>1.1 is 1 + .1; "hi" is "h" + "i"</code>.  Boolean values
       cannot be combined, they are simply either true or they are false.  A
       variable is undefined if it is not initialized or assigned prior to
       using its value. 
       It can also happen when setting a variable to the results of a
       function that does not return a value. Some functions
       return
       undefined when they can't return what was requested, for instance
       when something isn't found. Undefined can be very useful and very
       hard to debug in some cases.
       </p>
       <code>a = 1 // variable a is defined to be 1
var b // variable b is declared but undefined
var c = 1 // variable c is declared and set to 1
</code>
       </p>
       <p>
       Additionally JavaScript has compound data types including a
       <strong>array</strong>,
       e.g., [1,2,3, "fish"] is an array of data elements, each element may be
       a different data type.
       </p>
       <code>// assigning an array to a variable
a = [1, 2, 3, 5]; //a is list of numbers
     
// access an element of an array
b = a[1]; // b is second element of list a, so it is 2
</code>
       <p>
       Another compound JavaScript data element is <strong>object</strong>. An
       object is similar to a list in that it is a collection of values,
       but in an object each value or attribute is named. Let's say you
       want an object to define the characteristics of a dog. You might
       define a dog object as in the following code.
       </p>
       <code>dog = {
  name: "Fido",
  breed: "dalmatian",
  color: "white and black",
  gender: "M",
  age: 3
}

// accessing an element of the object
breedOfDog = dog.breed  // breedOfDog = "dalmatian"

ageOfDog = dog["age"] // ageOfDog = 3
</code>
       <p>
       An object may be a collection of primitive data types and compound
       data types like lists and other objects.  Internally all data within
       JavaScript is handled as an object.  Even a JavaScript function is
       treated as an object.
       </p>
       <p>
       JavaScript is said to be <strong>typeless</strong>. This really
       means that the language doesn't
       check the type of a variable when setting it.  So you can set
       variable <span class="var">a</span> to 1 and a while later set
       <span class="var">a</span> to "hi."
       JavaScript doesn't mind a bit, but this can lead to errors especially
       when unintentionally reusing a variable or having a number when you
       expect a string.
       </p>
     <h3>Functions with Parameters</h3>
       <p>
         A more powerful version of a function is a function that is called
         with one or more parameters. A parameter is named like a variable and
         may be any data type. It may be just about anything that the
         function needs to complete its task.
         There is no limit to the number of parameters that a function can
         use, but it is usually wise to keep the number down to the minimum
         required for the particular function.
       </p>
       <code>function square (size) { // size is a single parameter
  forward (size); // here it is used in the forward function call
  right (90);
  forward (size); // here it is used in the forward function call
  right (90);
  forward (size); // here it is used in the forward function call
  right (90);
  forward (size); // here it is used in the forward function call
  right (90);
}
</code>
       <p>
       A function is invoked with its name and supplying
       <strong>arguments</strong> as
       needed. The value of the arguments is passed to the function
       parameters.  Notice how inside a function, the passed values are
       called parameters and when the function is invoked,
       the values are called arguments. In JavaScript functions are said to
       be called by value, so the value is copied from the argument to the
       parameter. The function cannot affect the value of the arguments
       in the caller. (There is an exception to this with passing objects
       in a certain way, but that is left as an exercise for the reader.)
       </p>
       <code>square (10)  // invokes the square function with one argument '10'
             // to produce a square with each side equal to 10.
</code>
       <p>
       A function may also <strong>return</strong> a value by using the
       <code>return</code> key
       word. For example let's say you want a
       function that produces the cube of a number. Such code would look like
       the following.
       </p>
       <code>function cube( number) {
  return number * number * number
}

b = cube (2) // b = 8
c = cube (10) // c = 1000
</code>
     <h3 id=expressions>Expressions</h3>
       <p>
         Expressions are a way of combining variables, numbers, strings and
         Boolean values into other
         forms. Expressions have operators that act upon one or more operands.
         Much of this is familiar. Adding two numbers to produce a sum.
         Subtracting one number from another to find a difference. Dividing
         one number by another to get get a dividend, proportion or ratio.
       </p>
     <h4>Assignment Operators</h4>
       <p>
       Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. You can't
       change the value of number or a string as these are
       <strong>constant</strong>or <strong>immutable</strong> (unchangeable).
       </p>

     <h4>Number Operators</h4>
       <p>
       Number operators are used to manipulate numbers to get sums, differences,
       products, dividends, remainders, etc.
       </p>
       <table>

       </tr>
       </table>
     <h4>String Operators</h4>
       <p>
       There is a operator to manipulate strings.
       </p>
       <table>
         <tr>
           <th>Operator</th> <th>Use</th> <th>Example</th> <th>Result</th>
         </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>+</td>
         <td><strong>concatenate</strong> or join</td>
         <td>"tom" + "cat"</td>
         <td>"tomcat"</td>
       </tr>
       </table>
     <h4>Boolean Operators</h4>
       <p>
       There are a set of operators to manipulate Boolean values.
       Remember that a Boolean can only be either true or
       false.
       </p>
       <table>
         <tr>
           <th>Operator</th> <th>Use</th> <th>Example</th> <th>Result</th>
         </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>&&</td>
         <td>logical AND</td>

         <td>!a</td>
         <td>true if a is false, else true</td>
       </tr>
       </table>
     <h4>Comparison Operators</h4>
       <p>
         Comparison operators are used to compare two operands to result
         in a Boolean true or false value.
         Not that equality is similar to assignment.
       </p>
       <table>
         <tr>
           <th>Operator</th> <th>Use</th> <th>Example</th> <th>Result</th>

         <td rowspan=2>==</td>
         <td rowspan=2>equality</td>
         <td>a == b</td>
         <td>true if a evaluates to b, else false. Be careful with this
           when comparing different types.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>1 == "1"</td>
         <td>true, both evaluate to "1"</td>
       </tr>

     <h3 id=statements>Statements</h3>
       <p>
         Usually there is one JavaScript statement per line, but you can
         put more on a line as long as each statement is separated with a
         semicolon ';'. In modern browsers this semicolon is optional.
          Some programmers like to end each statement with a semi-colon
         anyway. Some statements may span more than one line, especially
         complex assignment statements.  JavaScript determines the end of
         a statement explicitly with the presence of the semi-colon or it
         guesses the end of statement by the context of the various lines of
         code as in the following example.
       </p>
      <code>a = 1; // statement with ending semicolon
a = 1 // statement without the ending semicolon
a = 1; b = 2 // two statements on a line
a = 1 // could be the end or not depending on what follows
  + 1  // appended to preceding line
  + 1 // appended to the preceding lines
  + 2 // appended to the preceding lines, so a = 5
b = 3 // another statement
</code>
       <p>
       Now let's try some Turtle Graphics functions.
       These statements are simple function calls.
       turn the turtle the right 90 degrees, <code>right(90)</code>, and
       move the turtle forward 10 units, <code>forward(10)</code>.
       </p>
<code>right(90)
forward(10)
right(90)
forward(10)
right(90)
forward(10)
right(90)
</code>

       <img src="images/no_picture.png">
       <p>
       This tells the turtle to move and turn, move and turn, move and turn,
       move and turn to complete a square as in the following figure.
       </p>
       <p>
         Some of JavaScript's constructs come in pairs. Strings are
         enclosed in pair of single quotes (apostrophes) or a pair of double
         quotes. A single quote may appear in a string set off with double
         quotes and a double quote may appear in a string set of with single
         quotes. An opening parentheses, square bracket, or curly brace
         (brace), must be matched with the closing parentheses, square bracket
         or curly brace.
       </p>
      <code>r = 'string' // string of characters
a = "string" // string of characters
b = ' another string' // string of characters
b = (2 + 3) * 5 // parentheses to affect order of calculation
    // b = 25
b = 2 + 3 * 5 // without parentheses, multiplication
    // take precedence over addition, so b = 17
d = [a, b, c] // list of variables
function foo (a, b, c) // group of parameters
  { statement, statement, statement} ; // group of statements in a function
f = foo (1, 2, 3) // group of arguments 1,2,3
  { a=1; b=2; c=a+b} // group of statements
dog = { breed: "dalmatian",        //object with 4 attributes
        color: "white and black",
        gender: "M",
        age:2
      }

   <h2 id="basic javascript concepts">Basic JavaScript Concepts</h2>
     <h3>Conditionals</h3>
       <img src="images/no_picture.png">
     <p>
       A <strong>conditional</strong> is code that is executed when some
       Boolean condition
       is true or false.  Conditionals start with an
       <span class="keyword">if</span> key word
       followed by an expression, called the <strong>condition</strong>,
       contained within parentheses which evaluates to a Boolean value,
       either <span class="keyword">true</span> or
       <span class="keyword">false</span>.
       This is followed by a single statement or a block
       of statements surrounded by curly braces that is executed if
       the condition is true.
       This statement or group of statements is sometimes called
       the <strong>then clause</strong> of the conditional.
       Many programmers always use the curly brackets to make their code
       more consistent, even if there is only a single statement.  The
       <span class="keyword">if</span>
       statement can be followed immediately by the
       <span class="keyword">else</span> keyword
       followed with a single statement or a block of statements surrounded
       by curly braces.
       This statement or group of statements is sometimes called
       the <strong>else clause</strong> of the conditional.
       The else clause is executed if the condition is false.
     </p>
     <code>function square() {
  for (i=0; i<4; i=i+1) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) { //i is even
      color (blue);
      width (4);
    } else {
      color (black);
      width (.5);
    }
    forward(50);
    right(90);
  }
}
</code>
     <p>
       Note: JavaScript allows the use of the short cuts <code>i++</code>
       instead of "<code>=i+1</code> and <code>i--</code> instead of
       <code>i=i-1</code>. The long form is used here and most of the
       examples to make the code easier to understand and less prone
       to errors.
     </p>
     <h3>Iteration</h3>
       <p>
         Computer science calls the process of doing things over and
         over, <strong>iteration</strong>. Turtle graphics give you a way to
         do iteration with the
         <code>repeat(<span class="var">count</span>, <span class="var">function</span>)</code>
         statement. This lets you
         execute a defined function a number of times.
       </p>
       <code>function square (size) {
  repeat (4, function () {
    forward (size);
    right (90);
  })
}
</code>
       <p>
         So in using a while statement, there are three things you need to
         do:
       </p>
         <ul>
           <li>
             Set up the initial condition of the loop.
           </li>
           <li>
             Test the condition to see whether to continue
             or not. It is important that there be a condition
             that will turn false to prevent the code from looping
             forever, a so-called <strong>infinite loop</strong>.
           </li>
           <li>
             Change the condition within the loop.
           </li>
         </ul>
       <img src="images/no_picture.png">
       <p>
         In the example, the condition being tested is the turtle running
         off of the screen. Since its path is enlarged each loop, eventually
         it should run off the screen and prevent an infinite loop.
       </p>
       <code>function spiral () {
  var i = 0;
  while ( i < 10) {
    forward (i + i);
    right (90 - i);
    i = i + 1;
  }
}
</code>
       <p>
         In this example, the condition is initialized with <code>i = 0</code>.
         The continuing condition is <code>i &gt; 10</code>, so the stopping
         condition would be <code>i >= 10</code>. The condition is changed
         within the loop with <code>i = i + 1</code>.
       </p>
         <img src="images/no_picture.png">
       <p>
         Sometimes you want the repetition to continue until some other
         criteria is met. Below is an example of a spiral that will expand
         until it moves off of the canvas. This example also shows a variable
         that is increased in value for each loop to make the length of the
         sides increase. The condition for continuing the loop is whether the
         turtle remains withing the bounds of the canvas. This is inherently
         initialized when the program starts. It is changed every iteration
         when the turtle moves. It should be noted that if the turtle does
         not move in bigger and bigger paths, the program will get stuck in
         an infinite loop.
       </p>
       <code>function spiral () {
  wrap(false);
  var i = 1;
  while ( turtle.pos.x < maxX()
          && turtle.pos.x > minX()
          && turtle.pos.y < maxY()
          && turtle.pos.y > minY()) {
    forward (i + i);
    right (90 - i);
    i = i + 1;
  }
}
</code>
       <p>
         JavaScript has other way of doing iteration loops, but a commonly
         used one is the for loop. It uses the
         <span class="keyword">for</span> key word followed by three sub-statements
         enclosed in parentheses and separate with semi-colons. The
         three sub-statements:
         initialization, while condition, and iterator. Initialization is used to
         initialize the value of the iteration variable or iterator. This
         variable is commonly named 'i', but any valid variable name can be
         used. Make sure to include a declaration for the iterator using the
         keyword <span class="keyword">var</span> somewhere within the function.
         The second part, the while condition 
         is an expression that is evaluated before every loop and must
         evaluate to <span class="keyword">true</span> for the loop to
         be executed. The third and
         last part is the iterator where something is done to change the
         looping variable at the bottom of the loop. Most of the time the
         parts are fairly simple as in the following now familiar example:
       </p>
       <code>function square() {
  for (i=0; i<4; i=i+1) {
    forward(20);
    right(90);
  }
}
</code>
     <h3 id=scope>Scope of Variables</h3>
       <p>
         Variables declared within a function are local to that function and
         can only be accessed within that function. These variables are called
         <strong>local</strong> variables.  Variables declared outside functions
         and variables that are not declared with the <span class="keyword">var</span>
         can be accessed by any function.  These variables are called
         <strong>global</strong> variables.  Most programmers try to avoid global
         variables to limit the number of functions that can change the
         value of a variable.
       </p>
       <p>
         Let's say you want to use the variable <span class="var">i</span>
         within an iteration to keep track of how many times the loop has been
         executed as is common practice.  If you don't declare
         <span class="var">i</span> with <span class="keyword">var</span>
         within each function,
         <span class="var">i</span> will default to being a global variable,
         accessible by all functions that don't declare
         <span class="var">i</span> locally.  Let's say you want to draw 3
         squares using a square function that draws the four sides.  The
         code looks like:
       </p>
<code>function square (side) {
  for (i=0; i<4; i=i+1) {
    forward( side)
    right( 90)
  }
}

for (i=0; i<3; i=i+1) {
  square( 100)
  right(30)
}
</code>
       <p>
         So what happens when this is executed? For the first loop of the
         main program the variable <span class="var">i</span> is set to
         zero and the function square is called. Square also sets the
         variable <span class="var">i</span> is also
         set to zero. No problem yet, but as the sides are drawn,
         <span class="var">i</span>
         is incremented to 1, 2, 3 and finally 4. When the square function
         returns, the variable <span class="var">i</span> is 4. When the
         code loops back to the <code>for</code> instruction for the loop
         check, <span class="var">i</span> being 4 is not less than 3, so
         the looping stops and only one square is drawn. Not exactly what
         was intended.
       </p>
       <p>
         To fix this, one might try to declare <span class="var">i</span>
         with the <code>var</code> instruction.  If the declaration is outside
         of the functions, at it is in the following block of code,
         <span class="var">i</span> is declared as a global. Since any
         undeclared variable is a global by default, this declaration has
         no effect.
       </p>
       <code>function square (side) {
  for (i=0; i<4; i=i+1) {
    forward( side)
    right( 90)
  }
}

var i; // declares i as a global variable
for (i=0; i<3; i=i+1) {
  square( 100)
  right(30)
}
</code>
       <p>
         The proper way to fix this is to either change the variable
         names so there is no conflict or to declare the variable within
         the function to make it a local variable. Changing the name can
         be difficult for large programs, so let's learn to use local
         variables when we can. In the following block of code, the variable
         <span class="var">i</span> is declared as a local within the square()
         function
         (that is, within the outer most curly braces of the function definition).
         Now it is as if there were two variables named
         <span class="var">i</span> and
         they are totally independent of each other, one local to the square
         function and one global.  The code will draw the three squares as
         desired.
       </p>
       <code>function square (side) {
  var i; // declares i as a local variable
  for (i=0; i<4; i=i+1) {
    forward( side)
    right( 90)
  }
}

var i; // declares i as a global variable
       // even though not necessary, it is
       // good practice to declare all variables.
for (i=0; i<3; i=i+1) {
  square( 100)
  right(30)
}
</code>
       <p>
         In general programmers try to avoid using global variables. This is
         because they can get changed by any function and sometimes it is
         hard to know which function is affecting the variables. Local
         variables are only affected within the function so it is easier to
         find the culprit.
       </p>
       <p>
         As a side note. In the above example, the parameters for a function
         are automatically local variables, declared with the
         <code>function</code> definition. So <span class="var">side</span>
         is a local
         variable within the square() function.

     <h3>Advanced Assignment Operators</h3>
       <p>
       We talked about the assignment operator <code>=</code>.
       There are other more specialized assignment operators.
       In general these should be avoided because they do cause
       some confusion and may lead to bugs if the symbols
       are interchanged. (<code>+=</code> is an assignment adding
       the right hand side to the left hand side of the expression.
       <code>=+</code> is an assignment of the positive value of
       the right hand side to the left hand side of the expression.)

     <h3>Bit-wise Operators</h3>
       <p>
       There are operators to perform bit-wise operations on numbers. These
       numbers are restricted to 32 bits, which is smaller than normal
       integers and floating point numbers (52 bits). Some
       of these operations
       are similar to the Boolean operators, except that they work on
       individual bits instead of the value as a whole. While
       this is a more advanced topic, it is nice to know that more exists in
       case you encounter them, or need them for a particular problem. The
       bit-wise operators are shown in the following table. The binary
       equivalents of the decimal numbers are shown in parentheses.
       </p>

     <h3>Grouping Operator and Order of Precedence</h3>
       <p>
         Using a set of parentheses is used to group operands and
         operators to affect the order of evaluation. Operators have an
         order of precedence that dictates the order in which the operators
         are evaluated, e.g., multiplication takes precedence over addition,
         so multiplications are done before additions.  The grouping operator
         takes precedence over other operators, so what is within the
         parentheses is evaluated before what is outside the parentheses.
         Parentheses may be nested. When in doubt and order matters, use
         parentheses.
       </p>
       <p>
         The following table is ordered from highest (20) to lowest (1)
         precedence (taken from the
         <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence">Mozilla.org</a>.
         This is the full set of precedence. Many of the operators are beyond
         the scope of this simple introduction, but are included to inspire
         you to learn more (not to scare you).

     <h3>Recursion</h3>
       <p>
         Recursion is special way to to something over and over again. It is similar
         to iteration in that regard. The main difference is that iteration is a loop
         within a single routine that is executed over and over. Recursion is a function
         that calls itself until some criteria is met.
         A T-shirt sums it up nicely: "If you don't understand recursion, read again."
         Some problems are easier to solve with iteration and some are easier to solve
         with recursion.
       </p>
       <img src="images/no_picture.png">
       <p>
         Consider a Koch line. Take a line of a given length. Divide that line
         into thirds. Where the middle
         third is, draw an equilateral triangle (a triangle with all three sides the same
         length and the corner angles are also all the same, 60 degrees). Erase the middle
         segment, leaving four segments each of the same length. Repeat the process for
         the remaining four segments and so on until the segment length is 2 pixels. The
         following code does just that.
       </p>
       <code>function kochForward (length) {
  if (length <= 20) {
    forward (length);
  } else {
    kochForward (length/3);
    left(60);
    kochForward (length/3);
    right(120);
    kochForward (length/3);
    left(60);
    kochForward (length/3);
  }
}

setpos(minX() + 20, minY() + 20); // go toward bottom left of canvas
angle(90);
kochForward(maxX() + maxX() - 40); // draw a Koch line most of the width of the canvas
</code>
       <p>
         Hint: you can change the value in the conditional (the 20) to other values
         to show more or less detail. The Koch line is the basis for the Koch
         Snowflake that uses three Koch lines.
       </p>
       <p>
         There are several more complex examples of recursion here. The Koch
         Snowflakes, the Sierpinski Curve and the Symmetrical Tree.

   <h2 id=animation>Animation</h2>
     <p>
       <strong>Animation</strong> is the process to bring a drawing to life.
       Animation presents drawings that are slightly different.
       The differences are perceived as motion.
       The two main ways to do animation is to either incrementally add to a
       drawing more and more complex parts or to completely redraw the
       figure. The drawing that is presented is called a <strong>frame</strong>
       The human eye will blend motion between two different frames that are
       presented quick enough. Movies are about 24 frames a second and
       television is 30 frames a second (or 1/30 of a second per frame
       also called .033 seconds or 33 milliseconds per frame).  Making
       changes too quickly will be invisible to the human eye. Changes
       must be made fairly consistently to avoid a jerky appearance.
     </p>
     <p>
       This turtle graphics provide two functions for animation:
       <code>animate()</code> and <code>delay()</code> that
       are discussed more thoroughly below.
     </p>
     <h3>Animate</h3>
       <p>
         The <code>animate()</code> function is used to call a function over and
         over at a fixed period of time. The Turtle Graphics analog clock
         is an example that uses
         the animate function to redraw the clock and its hands every second.
       </p>
     <h3>Delay</h3>
       <p>
         The <code>delay()</code> function is used to call a function once after
         a period of time. For an animation there can be a series of
         functions that are invoked in a time sequence to provide the animation.
       </p>
       <p>
         The <em>Dividing a Circle</em> example uses the
         <code`>delay()</code`em> function to draw a set of circles around a
         preceding set of circles.  This is an example of building up a
         drawing of more and more complex parts.
       </p>
       <p>
         The <em>Koch Snowflake</em> example uses the
         <code>delay()</code> function to draw a successive drawings. 
         This example shows the power of using both the delay function to
         draw a snowflake of a particular order and recursion to build the
         snowflake of a desired order.

     <h3>Source Code</h3>
       <p>
         More can be learned by looking at the JavaScript source code that implements the
         turtle graphic functions. While the functions are designed to hide the
         details of the mathematics (trigonometry) that are necessary to plot a
         line of a given angle and length on a canvas that only understands the
         x and y coordinates of a Cartesian coordinate system.

         The following modules provide the basic functionality of the JavaScript
         Turtle Graphics.
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           <strong>turtle.html</strong> defines the layout and content of the page
           as basic HTML. This page contains the text of the language reference, the
           help text and this tutorial.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>turtle.css</strong> defines the styling used to make the page
           more readable as a <strong>Cascading Style Sheet</strong> (CSS).
           CSS allows the artistic design of the page to be separated from
           the functional underpinnings of the page.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>turtle.js</strong> defines the basic turtle graphics
           functions for JavaScript. In theory this module could be included
           in other programs which use turtle graphics.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>turtle_console.js</strong> defines the behind the scenes
           mechanisms to make this page work as a code development laboratory. It
           has the functions to pop up this tutorial and functions to hide and show
           the language reference and definitions sections of the work area.
           It also allows commands and definitions to be entered and executed.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>examples.js</strong> is a tool generated file that contains one string
           for each example. The examples are loaded directly onto the coding
           area of the console where they may be viewed and modified.
